#Problem: Access to adequate food is critical for basic human survival. This, in turn, impacts every aspect of life including culture, society, business and government. Yet people around the world struggle to have access enough access to food. This varies by region of the world. It is critical to understand how this trends has changed by time and how regional economies might be associated with it.

#How addressed: To understand trends, I access data from the United Nations and its Food and Agriculture Organization.

#Tools used: I used R Tidyverse to manipulate the data and then visualized the data using libraries shown in the R code.

#Outcome: I included insights on the visual itself to that readers can see everything conveniently in one place. I also made the visual rich - beyond standard visualizations that one would see in Power BI or Tableau etc. so that the visual tells the complete intended story. The result is a line chart with trending, but instead of traditional lines I use bubbles to also indicate regional GDP. The user can easily understand how GDP might be associated with food access. This, in turn, can prompt additional conversation and research.

#Impact: Governments and NGOs can use this information to help allocate food aid resources efficiently. Social impact businesses can also use this insight to identify market regions to launch solutions for improving food access.

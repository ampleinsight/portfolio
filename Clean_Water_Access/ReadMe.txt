#Problem: Access to clean water is critical for basic human survival. This, in turn, impacts every aspect of life including culture, society, business and government. Yet people around the world struggle to have access enough access to clean water. This varies by region of the world. It is critical to understand how this trends has changed by time and place -- and how many people it currently impacts.

#How addressed: To understand trends, I access data from the United Nations and its Food and Agriculture Organization.

#Tools used: I used R Tidyverse to manipulate the data and then visualized the data using libraries shown in the R code.

#Outcome: I included insights on the visuals themselves to that readers can see everything conveniently in one place. I also made the visual rich - beyond standard visualizations that one would see in Power BI or Tableau etc. so that each visual tells a complete story. The result is a side-by-side view of lollipop and heat map visuals showing how many people are impacted and how trends have changed by region.

#Impact: Governments and NGOs can use this information to help allocate water treatment resources efficiently. Social impact businesses can also use this insight to identify market regions to launch solutions for water purification.
